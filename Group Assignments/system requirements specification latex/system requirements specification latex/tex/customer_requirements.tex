This section outlines customer requirements. The requirements listed here are the functionalities of the hydrometer given by the user. These requirements are directly observable by the user.

\subsection{Measuring Specific Gravity of the Brew}
\subsubsection{Description}
Hydrometer will measure the specific gravity throughout the brewing process to estimate how many sugars can be converted to alcohol.
\subsubsection{Source}
The requirement was expressed by Chris Conly and his brewing team.
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The main constraint for this requirement will revolve around the timing of the brew and whether or not a brew will be available to perform the desired measurements on. Also, with the given limitations in place per government and university orders of social distancing, key testing for the given requirement may be hindered.
\subsubsection{Standards}

\subsubsection{Priority}
The priority of this requirement is critical as without it the product, i.e., the Hydrometer, will not work and be a failure.
\subsection{Measuring Temperature of the Brew}
\subsubsection{Description}
Hydrometer will measure the temperature throughout the brewing process to ensure the brew remains at the correct temperature during the most active phase of fermentation.
\subsubsection{Source}
The requirement was expressed by Chris Conly and his brewing team.
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The main constraint for this requirement will revolve around the timing of the brew and whether or not a brew will be available to perform the desired measurements on. Also, with the given limitations in place per government and university orders of social distancing, key testing for the given requirement may be hindered.
\subsubsection{Standards}

\subsubsection{Priority}
The priority of this requirement is \textbf{critical} as without it the product, i.e., the Hydrometer, will not work and be a failure.

\subsection{Sending Measurements to Mobile Application}
\subsubsection{Description}
Hydrometer, once finished with measurements, will send critical measured data to the mobile application to be analyzed by the user.
\subsubsection{Source}
The requirement was expressed by Chris Conly and his brewing team.
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The main constraint for this requirement will revolve around the timing of the brew and whether or not a brew will be available to perform the desired measurements on. Also, with the given limitations in place per government and university orders of social distancing, key testing for the given requirement may be hindered.
\subsubsection{Standards}
\subsubsection{Priority}
The priority of this requirement is \textbf{high}. The project will result in a success and have desired basic functionality without this requirement but will lack optimal functionality.
