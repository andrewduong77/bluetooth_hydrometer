Include a header paragraph specific to your product here. Customer requirements are those required features and functions specified for and by the intended audience for this product. This section establishes, clearly and concisely, the "look and feel" of the product, what each potential end-user should expect the product do and/or not do. Each requirement specified in this section is associated with a specific customer need that will be satisfied. In general Customer Requirements are the directly observable features and functions of the product that will be encountered by its users. Requirements specified in this section are created with, and must not be changed without, specific agreement of the intended customer/user/sponsor.

\subsection{Measuring Specific Gravity of the Brew}
\subsubsection{Description}
Hydrometer will measure the specific gravity throughout the brewing process to estimate how many sugars can be converted to alcohol.
\subsubsection{Source}
The requirement was expressed by Chris Conly and his brewing team.
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The main constraint for this requirement will revolve around the timing of the brew and whether or not a brew will be available to perform the desired measurements on. Also, with the given limitations in place per government and university orders of social distancing, key testing for the given requirement may be hindered.
\subsubsection{Standards}

\subsubsection{Priority}
The priority of this requirement is critical as without it the product, i.e., the Hydrometer, will not work and be a failure.
\subsection{Measuring Temperature of the Brew}
\subsubsection{Description}
Hydrometer will measure the temperature throughout the brewing process to ensure the brew remains at the correct temperature during the most active phase of fermentation.
\subsubsection{Source}
The requirement was expressed by Chris Conly and his brewing team.
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The main constraint for this requirement will revolve around the timing of the brew and whether or not a brew will be available to perform the desired measurements on. Also, with the given limitations in place per government and university orders of social distancing, key testing for the given requirement may be hindered.
\subsubsection{Standards}

\subsubsection{Priority}
The priority of this requirement is \textbf{critical} as without it the product, i.e., the Hydrometer, will not work and be a failure.

\subsection{Sending Measurements to Mobile Application}
\subsubsection{Description}
Hydrometer, once finished with measurements, will send critical measured data to the mobile application to be analyzed by the user.
\subsubsection{Source}
The requirement was expressed by Chris Conly and his brewing team.
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The main constraint for this requirement will revolve around the timing of the brew and whether or not a brew will be available to perform the desired measurements on. Also, with the given limitations in place per government and university orders of social distancing, key testing for the given requirement may be hindered.
\subsubsection{Standards}
\subsubsection{Priority}
The priority of this requirement is \textbf{high}. The project will result in a success and have desired basic functionality without this requirement but will lack optimal functionality.
