\subsection{Layer Hardware}
The phone layer will be a mobile application emulated on a physical computer operating system with the ability to connect wireless via Bluetooth to the Controller Subsystems. It will process data given to it from the Controller subsystem and transfer it to the subsystems inside the Phone Layer.

\subsection{Layer Operating System}
The physical system's Operating System emulating the Android application will be macOS Catalina version 10.15.6 and the emulated Operating System will be Android Ice Cream Sandwich version 4.0.

\subsection{Layer Software Dependencies}
The main dependency that will be operating is Android Studio and SDK tools version 4.0.1.
